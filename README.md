- I created and developed an application that manages the infor mation for a basic social network.

- Each member of the network has a profile that includes their name, current status, and a list of connections.

- The application allows users to join and leave the network, create and edit their profile, search for other profiles, and add connections.

- I utilized a graph data structure to track the connections among network members and implemented a feature that enables users to view a list of their connections' connections.
